# Defining the stakeholders

Lead the class in a discussion of internal and external stakeholders. Encourage students to think beyond the obvious.

## Exercise

After the class identifies the stakeholders for the example project, have the students list the stakeholders for their own projects, then share them with the class. Discuss.

Below are examples of stakeholders for the URL Shortener project.

### External stakeholders

1. Users that doesn't want a long URL
2. Friends that share short links on Whatsapp can type a short link
3. Colleague can use that for sharing links
4. The media
5. Curious onlookers (future users?)

### Internal stakeholders

1. The site owner
2. The developers
3. The testers
4. The marketers

## Successful completion

Each student should have developed a list of stakeholders for his or her project.
