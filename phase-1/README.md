# Phase 1

This phase is about getting a taste for basic web development and instilling some basic programming fundamentals. It contains two parts:

1. Programming Fundamentals
2. Build an Application (2048)

## Programming Fundamentals

From our previous class experience, a lost of students struggled with fundamental programming concepts all the way up until Phase 2. So this time, we will spend the first two weeks covering these concepts first:

Objectives:

1. Get students ready to learn in the course
2. Provide some fun ice-breaking exercises
3. Set classroom culture:
    - Open minded
    - No one can know everything
    - Experimentation + trial and error is good
    - Community
    - Students are Web Devs on day one
4. Learn the skills to learn. Teach themselves and others programming languages
5. Excite the students about learning the what's to come in the course
6. Share best practices and when to use them
7. Setup computer environment (Just In Time)

## Build an Application

Hello World application is quite common, but it's too easy and a bit boring. Let's build a fun game, 2048.
