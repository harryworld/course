# Developing job stories

Let's create job stories for our new project. Why not?

## Exercise

This is not meant to be a complete list. We'll iterate (as time permits).

    When I am ready to use the application
    I want to log in
    So I can keep my data private

    When I'm logged in,
    I want to see my list of links in an editable format
    So I can make changes as needed

    When I'm ready to share my link
    I want to be able to retrieve a coded link 
    So I can make the make my life easier


## Successful completion

Students should have a good list of job stories ready for Trello (or equivalent) for their individual projects.
