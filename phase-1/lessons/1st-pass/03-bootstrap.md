## Alternative way of using Bootstrap

Use a CDN instead of downloading the package. Why?

- Handling of http vs https
- No need to manage the file storage
- Offload the responsibility to 3rd party service provider (Internet way of Don't Repeat Yourself / DRY)

Downside?:

- The library is updated without testing -> not a problem for small project
