## Exercise

Ask the students to identify stakeholders for the 2048 project.

Example list of stakeholders:

1. External stakeholders (audience)
  1. Players (wants to play game)
  2. Observers (wants to watch game)
  3. Media (wants to report about site)
2. Internal stakeholders
  1. Site owner (takes ownership of site)
  2. Site developers (has to code site)
  3. Site designers (has to design site)
  4. Marketing, etc.

Discuss what types of concerns each of the above might have with regard to the way the site looks, operates, is coded, etc.

## Successful completion

The student has a list of stakeholders and a clear idea of what that stakeholder's interest is in the application.

**NOTE: We only have time for a quick pass at this. On the job, this would most likely be a much more thorough and involved process.**
