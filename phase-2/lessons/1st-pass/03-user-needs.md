# Conducting needs assessments

Conduct internal and external needs assessments for the stakeholders identified earlier. It would be good to have both **user needs** and some **product objectives**.

The two questions that must be answered at this level are:

1. What do we (the creators of this software) want to get out of it?
2. What do our **users** want to get out of it?

The instructor does this quickly for the example project, then the students do assessments for their own sites.

## User needs

Discuss the needs of the various users - users who need the function, the media, etc. For this project, we will focus only on the needs of colleagues. These needs include:

### Colleagues

1. Input Public URL
2. Obtain a coded link to share to friends
3. URL will be redirected after visiting the coded link
4. Register a user, login
5. Logged-in user would delete the link he creates

Eventually, we want to extend this to become a API system where the user can create the coded link throught API as needed (and without a lot of repetitive work). Also, link creators could visit the Analytics page for the usage of each link.

## Product objectives

Our site is being created as a training exercise, so we'll have objectives related to that. In a production application, these would probably not apply.

### Training objectives

1. Learn basic Ruby on Rails
2. Learn MVC, RESTful, CRUD the Rails way
3. Learn BDD using Rails
4. Improve facility with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, REST, etc.
5. See another project through from start to finish
6. Apply these new skills in a personal project (which may be for production deployment)

### Production objectives

1. Develop a valuable user base
2. Build a large database of user-generated data
3. Targeted advertising
4. Fast, scalable, robust, and efficient (to save money)

## Successful completion

The students should have identified many potential user needs and product objectives for their own projects.
