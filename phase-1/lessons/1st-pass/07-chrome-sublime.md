# Chrome & Sublime

It's time to setup the daily tools for web developers.

## Chrome

Since we need a browser to view the website, we want some good tools to debug as well, here comes with Chrome.

### console.log

### Plugins

## Sublime

Sublime is the tool that many developers use, it has the ability to add package, which provides additional tools when needed. One can customize the environment to whatever he wants, but there are still some common packages, like hightlighter or linter.

### Package Control

## Build frontend JavaScript
