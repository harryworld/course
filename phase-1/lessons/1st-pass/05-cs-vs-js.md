# CoffeeScript vs. JavaScript

CoffeeScript is a relatively new programming language that compiles down into JavaScript which can then run wherever a JavaScript interpreter is available&mdash;for example, in pretty much every single web browser on the planet.

CoffeeScript offers many benefits over JavaScript. It's sole significant drawback being that it needs to be compiled before it can be run in the browser. But this con brings with it the pro that the compiler can often catch errors that might be missed otherwise.

## Discussion

We'll be providing examples of JavaScript equivalents throughout the course, but we'll be writing mostly CoffeeScript.

One easy way to learn JavaScript is to write CoffeeScript, then use the coffee-script node.js compiler to compile the CS to JS. We can then see how the compiler would write the JavaScript code.

But to really get good at JavaScript, we'll need to write JS code from scratch. We'll do that later in the course when we've gotten comfortable with programming in CoffeeScript and have learned most of the syntactical differences between the two languages.

## Examples

Choose and run some examples from the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) page while the students ask questions. (Ask the students questions as well.)

## Successful completion

The students understand the basics of converting CoffeeScript to JavaScript and vice versa and can use the CoffeeScript API to figure out the rest.
