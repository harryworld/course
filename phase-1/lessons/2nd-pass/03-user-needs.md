# Needs assessments

Conduct internal and external needs assessments for the stakeholders identified earlier. It would be good to have both **user needs** and some **product objectives**.

The two questions that must be answered at this level are:

1. What do we (the creators of this software) want to get out of it?
2. What do our **users** want to get out of it?

## Exercise

### User needs

Discuss the needs of the various users - players, observers, media. For this project, we will focus only on the needs of the players. These needs include (but are not limited to) the ability to:

1. Start a game
2. Make a move (with visual feedback)
3. Know when a game has been won, lost, or tied
4. Start a new game

In addition, these would be nice to have features:

1. High scores
2. Replay old games
3. Invite a friend to play
4. Pause a game

Students may come up with others.

### Product objectives

We're not actually deploying this publicly, so our objectives are a bit murky. We have at least these:

1. Learn how to implement
2. Have fun
3. Impress our friends and families

If this were to be a production site, we might have had objectives such as improve brand identity, drive customers to our site, increase advertising clicks, etc.

## Successful completion

The students should have identified many potential user needs and product objectives.

**NOTE: We only have time for a quick pass at this. On the job, this would most likely be a much more thorough and involved process.**
