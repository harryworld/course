## BDD vs TDD

In software engineering, behavior-driven development (abbreviated BDD) is a software development process based on test-driven development (TDD).[1][2] Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software developers and business analysts with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development,[1][3] with the aim of delivering "software that matters".[4]
